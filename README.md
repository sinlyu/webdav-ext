## ⚙️ Commands

This extension contributes the following commands:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `automate-webdav.showDebug` | Show edoc Automate Debug Output |
| `automate-webdav.refreshWorkspace` | Refresh edoc Automate Workspace |
| `automate-webdav.addStubFile` | Add edoc Automate PHP Plugin API Stubs |
| `automate-webdav.setupPhpStubs` | Setup edoc Automate PHP Stubs |

## 🔧 Configuration

The extension uses VS Code's experimental search provider APIs and integrates with PHP Tools for enhanced development. All features are automatically configured when the extension is installed.

### PHP Development Settings
```json
{
  "webdav.includeStubs": true,
  "php.suggest.basic": true,
  "php.stubs": []
}
```

### Excluded Directories
The following directories are automatically excluded from search operations:
- `.git`, `.svn`, `.hg` (version control)
- `node_modules` (Node.js dependencies)
- `dist`, `build`, `target`, `bin`, `obj` (build artifacts)
- `.vscode`, `.idea` (IDE configuration)
- `.cache`, `.tmp`, `temp` (temporary files)

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Search Not Working
1. Ensure VS Code version is 1.101.0 or higher
2. Check edoc Automate connection in the debug output
3. Verify experimental APIs are enabled (automatic)

### PHP IntelliSense Not Working
1. Install PHP Tools extension for enhanced PHP support
2. Ensure edoc Automate connection is established
3. Check that stub files are generated (automatic)

### Connection Issues
1. Verify edoc Automate server URL and credentials
2. Ensure URL follows format: https://server.com/apps/remote/project
3. Check network connectivity and CORS settings
4. Review debug output for detailed error messages

### Performance
- **Initial indexing**: Large directories are indexed automatically on connection (runs in background)
- **Lightning-fast search**: File name searches use cached index for instant results
- **Smart updates**: Index is updated automatically when files change
- **Optimized operations**: Excluded directories are skipped during indexing and search
- **Best practices**: Use specific search patterns for optimal performance
