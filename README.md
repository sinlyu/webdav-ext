## ⚙️ Commands

This extension contributes the following commands:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `automate-webdav.showDebug` | Show WebDAV Debug Output |
| `automate-webdav.refreshWorkspace` | Refresh WebDAV Workspace |

## 🔧 Configuration

The extension uses VS Code's experimental search provider APIs. These are automatically enabled when the extension is installed.

### Excluded Directories
The following directories are automatically excluded from search operations:
- `.git`, `.svn`, `.hg` (version control)
- `node_modules` (Node.js dependencies)
- `dist`, `build`, `target`, `bin`, `obj` (build artifacts)
- `.vscode`, `.idea` (IDE configuration)
- `.cache`, `.tmp`, `temp` (temporary files)

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Search Not Working
1. Ensure VS Code version is 1.101.0 or higher
2. Check WebDAV connection in the debug output
3. Verify experimental APIs are enabled (automatic)

### Connection Issues
1. Verify WebDAV server URL and credentials
2. Check network connectivity
3. Review debug output for detailed error messages

### Performance
- **Initial indexing**: Large directories are indexed automatically on connection (runs in background)
- **Lightning-fast search**: File name searches use cached index for instant results
- **Smart updates**: Index is updated automatically when files change
- **Optimized operations**: Excluded directories are skipped during indexing and search
- **Best practices**: Use specific search patterns for optimal performance
